1. Download the spiral.txt file from the Blue Team Con 2023 website
2. Recognize that the spiral filename is likely a reference to the spiral cipher
3. Open a spiral cipher decoder, such as https://www.dcode.fr/spiral-cipher
4. Paste the contents of spiral.txt into the decoder and allow the brute force to run
5. Look through the results and find the one has no holes in the middle and a double-equals sign at the end (a common sign of base64 encoding). See attached image.
6. Paste the result into a base64 decoder
7. The flag is present in the decoded base64 output, which can be seen below:

Continuous or recurring feelings
That you're an outside observer of your thoughts
Feeling like you are a robot
Or feeling like you are living in a dream or in a movie
The sensation that you're not in control of your actions
Including speaking
Awareness that your sense of detachment
Is only a feeling, and not reality
The sense that your body, legs or arms
Appear distorted, enlarged, or shrunken
Feeling like you are observing yourself
From above
As if you were floating in the air
BTC{TheFearofVision-TheFlashbulb.}

8. The flag must have the period removed for it be accepted, making the final flag "BTC{TheFearofVision-TheFlashbulb}"
